# Coastline Charging – Roadmap

**A real-world EV charging service, building toward something bigger.**

Coastline Charging began as a mobile DC fast charging service in Orange County, California.  
In two years, we’ve delivered over 100,000 miles of EV range across thousands of sessions —  
all without public funding or venture capital.

We’ve built and stress-tested the systems ourselves: dispatch, routing, pricing, and ops.  
Now, with a proven service layer and real traction on the ground, we’re laying the foundation  
for the next chapter — one rooted in openness, interoperability, and community-aligned energy protocols.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — Core Ops Foundation (Completed)
- Launched mobile DC fast charging across Orange County  
- Refined dispatch, routing, and pricing systems in live environments  
- Proved unit economics across both consumer and fleet segments  
- Delivered 100,000+ miles of EV range in thousands of sessions  

---

## 📱 Phase 2 — App Layer & Tooling (In Progress)
- Launch beta mobile app (iOS + Android) for EV drivers  
- Build internal dashboards for live session tracking + routing  
- Release public API for requesting mobile charge sessions  
- Pilot fleet integrations with early partners  
- Stress-test systems under increasing session volume and geographic load  

---

## 🌐 Phase 3 — Community Access & Interoperability (Planning)
- Publish interface specs for dispatch, routing, and unit compatibility  
- Onboard third-party operators into shared service workflows  
- Design lightweight credentialing and discovery systems  
- Improve resilience and visibility across distributed mobile units  

---

## 🧬 Phase 4 — Distributed Coordination & Protocol R&D (Exploratory)
- Explore cryptographic anchoring of session data for transparency, auditability, and optional on-chain integration
- Develop dynamic dispatch logic using auction-style or performance-weighted selection  
- Prototype lightweight credentialing and reputation scoring for independent node operators  
- Integrate OCPI bridges for seamless interoperability across mobile and fixed assets  
- Explore incentive layers for energy balancing, uptime coverage, and green sourcing  
- Build toward a modular protocol with decentralized scheduling, energy routing, and zone-level governance

## 👀 Why This Matters

By shifting energy demand from fixed sites to intelligent, distributed systems,  
we unlock reach, responsiveness, and new innovations to power our lives more intuitively.
